# SolsRadar

A plugin for Vencord.

Monitors channels for private Roblox server links and — if configured — joins them instantly.

> Built as a cleaner alternative to selfbot snipers. As a Vencord plugin, it runs natively inside Discord.

---

## Features

- **One-click access** to sniped private server links
- **Snipe history tab** to keep track of recent snipes
- **Extensive settings** to customize plugin behavior to your liking
- Possibly faster than most alternatives
- **No Discord token setup required** - as a Vencord plugin, it hooks natively into Discord's internals. No polling, no API spam; it simply listens to the `MESSAGE_CREATED` flux event directly.

## Installing

### Easy install (recommended)
Download the installer from [gitlab.com/masutty/solradar-installer](https://gitlab.com/masutty/solradar-installer) and run it. It should guide you on what you're missing and automate the Vencord installation steps.

### Manual install
If you know what you're doing, clone this repository inside your Vencord `userplugins` folder.

Otherwise, installing custom plugins requires Vencord to be installed from source. See:
- [Installing custom plugins on Vencord](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/)
- [Vencord from source](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/)
- [Community guide on Vencord's Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1015060230222131221/1257038407503446176)

> **Note:** This plugin is unrelated to Vencord's development team. Please do not ask for support in Vencord's Discord server — they won't be able to help.

## Configuration

- By default, the plugin **does not verify** whether a sniped server belongs to Sol's RNG.
- To enable verification, configure a `ROBLOSECURITY` token in the plugin settings. **This is optional** — snipes work without it, but the token makes them safer.

## Contributing

- Suggestions and feedback are welcome — send me a message on Discord.

This plugin was written pretty hastily and is far from perfect. If you're a Vencord plugin developer and feel like something could be done better — please reach out to me on Discord, I'd genuinely appreciate the help.
